BLE Explorer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a refresher exploration of BLE utilizing patterns I have used in the
past, but adding new types for managing received data such as Kotlin Flows. I 
have been tinkering with this locally on my computer (**not in git**) for a few 
months now. This is currently a work-in-progress. I have been updating the 
codebase as libraries have been updated. I decided to put it up on git to make
it easy for me to reference.

**NOTE** This is definitely not a hardened app.

As of right now it:
- Scans for devices
- Connects to devices
